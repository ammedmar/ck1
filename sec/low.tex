\section{Explicit descriptions of \( \bvbox_\infty \) algebras}

In this section, we build on the explicit description of \( \bv_\infty \)-algebras in terms of generating maps and relations as given in~\cite{GalvezTonksVallette} to present an analogous explicit description of \( \bvbox_\infty \)-algebras.
Furthermore, exploiting an operadic filtration, we introduce stricter structures that generalize \( \rC_{(n)} \)-algebras to both the \( \bv \) and \( \bvbox \) settings.


%\begin{remark}
%	\( Com \to \bv \) has a canonical factorization \( Com \xra{i} \bvbox \xra{p} \bv \) with \( i \) injective and quasi-iso and \( p \) a surjection.
%	The existance of this factorization seems to be implied by the factorization axiom of model categories.
%\end{remark}
%
%We will study algebras over these operads level by level.
%Let \( A \) be a graded vector space for the rest of this section.
