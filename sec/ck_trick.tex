\section{The colour-kinematic trick}

Let us now combine the structures we have overviewed so far.
Consider a bidifferential complex \( (\cK, d, d^\star) \) together with a commutative and associative product \( \mu \colon \cK \ot \cK \to \cK \)
for which \( d \) and \( d^\star \) are respectively of first and second order, i.e., \( [d, \mu] = 0 \) and \( \nu \defeq [d^\star, \mu] \) is a Lie bracket.
