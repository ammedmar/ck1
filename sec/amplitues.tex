Little summary of the tree-level amplitude via HHT paper.

Our goal is to transfer the Yang-Mills $L_\infty$ structure from $\mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{YM}}$ to a space $\bar{\mathcal{X}}_{\mathrm{YM}}$, where the fields $\bar{A}_\mu \in \bar{\mathcal{X}}_0$ are on-shell and transverse:
\begin{equation}
	\Box \bar{A}_\mu = 0\,, \qquad \partial \cdot \bar{A} = 0\,,
	\tag{3.20}
\end{equation}
which implies $\bar{B}_1(\bar{\mathcal{A}}) = 0$ for the differential on $\bar{\mathcal{X}}_{\mathrm{YM}}$. The fields $\bar{A}_\mu$ are still subject to residual on-shell gauge transformations $\delta \bar{A}_\mu = \partial_\mu \bar{\Lambda}$ for parameters obeying $\Box \bar{\Lambda} = 0$, meaning that the space $\bar{\mathcal{X}}_{-1}$ consists of harmonic gauge parameters. Furthermore, the on-shell and transverse conditions on $\bar{A}_\mu$ suggest that the space of currents $\bar{\mathcal{X}}_1$ contains on-shell vectors defined modulo gradients, while the space of Noether identities $\bar{\mathcal{X}}_2$ consists of harmonic scalars:
\begin{equation}
	\Box \bar{\mathcal{J}}_\mu = 0\,, \qquad \bar{\mathcal{J}}_\mu \sim \bar{\mathcal{J}}_\mu + \partial_\mu \Phi\,, \qquad \Box \bar{\mathcal{N}} = 0\,.
	\tag{3.21}
\end{equation}
The equivalence class condition defining $\bar{\mathcal{X}}_1$ ensures that the pairing between an on-shell and transverse field $\bar{A}_\mu$ with a current $\bar{\mathcal{J}}_\mu$ remains non-degenerate. Indeed, if $\int dx \, \mathrm{Tr}(\bar{A}^\mu \bar{\mathcal{J}}_\mu) = 0$
