\section{The bar-cobar resolution of the commutative operad}

We will focus on the operad \( \mathrm{Com} \).

For algebras over the Koszul resolution of commutative operad, i.e.,  \( \rC_\infty \)-algebras.
Their homotopy transfer is parameterized by using the combinatorial data of planar rooted graphs.
For algebras over the bar-cobar resolution of this operad we use non-planar trees.

\begin{theorem}
	...
\end{theorem}

In general there is a map from \( \mathrm{sLie}_\infty \) to the tensor product of ...

For infinity versions of commutative algebras it is not clear what this map looks like for \( C_\infty \), but for \( \rB\Omega\rC \) we have the following.

\begin{theorem}[RNV]
	Compatibility of transfers.
